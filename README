                            SVN Dump Tools
                         Daniel S. Wilkerson

File svn-dumpfile-grammar.txt is documentation for the grammar of an
svn dumpfile.

Tools svn-dump2dir and svn-dir2dump are utilities for easily hacking
on the history of a subversion repository.

Tool simple-patch is a simpler version of patch that you can control
much more easily than Larry Wall's patch (written in Perl; I can hear
Larry screaming).

All software is released under the BSD license, which you can find in
each program file.
